# About Me

I'm Chris! I'm a full-stack software engineer with a focus on telemetry, data visualization, and controls for hardware systems. I bring a unique interdisciplinary skillset that combines software, mechanical & electrical prototyping, and fabrication.

Besides engineering, I love running, boating, and the outdoors! I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2019. While there, I ran on the Track and Cross Country teams as a middle distance runner.

### What I'm Up To

I'm working at [908 Devices](http://908devices.com/) as a software engineer in R&D, working on 908 Devices' line of portable, chemical analysis devices based on high-pressure mass spectrometry.

I'm also building [TelemetryJet](https://www.telemetryjet.com/), a data collection & analysis platform for experimental hardware systems. 

In my spare time, I build and fly RC airplanes and drones.
