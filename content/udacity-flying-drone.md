I recently took the [Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787), an intensive 4-month online course through Udacity that covers introductory flight software engineering and algorithms for aerial vehicles.

I learned and implemented planning, controls, and estimation algorithms for flying vehicles.
Through the project-based curriculum, I built a complete software stack for autonomous quadrotors:

- Built a 3D motion planner for a simulated autonomous quadrotor in an urban environment, utilizing A* graph search
- Implemented a non-linear cascaded PID controller for quadrotor motion.
- Designed an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate attitude and position from IMU and GPS data. Combined the EKF with the controller from the previous project, and tuned parameters in a simulation to support flight.

The course was a great introduction to the fundamentals of controls for autonomous flying vehicles, and I look forward to continuing to learn in this growing field.

My course projects and exercises are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisdalke/udacity-flying-car-nanodegree).
