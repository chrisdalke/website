I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science. During my time at Rochester, I balanced an interdisciplinary mix of academics, athletics, and extracurriculars:

- I ran on the Track and Cross Country teams as a middle distance runner. I primarily ran the 800m, with a PR of 1:53.65. I was also one of the legs of Rochester's 4x400m team, which competed at NCAA nationals in early 2019.

- I spent all 4 years as a member and eventual team lead/president of the student-run Rochester Solar Splash solar-electric boat team.

- I graduated Cum Laude with a 3.7 GPA.

I have fond memories of my time at Rochester as a formative era in my life. I met some of my closest friends, grew as a person, athlete, and professional, and had plenty of fun!
