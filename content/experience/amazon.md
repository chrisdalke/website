I interned with Amazon in Seattle as a Software Development Intern in the summer of 2018. I worked on the Maps Services team, which owns the real time navigation infrastructure used to support last-mile delivery drivers.

### What I Worked On

I worked on a project to automate a critical data conversion process for map data. This project helps ensure map data is updated quickly,
providing accurate, up-to-date directions to drivers. 

- Used AWS CloudFormation, Lambda, and Data Pipeline to build infrastructure for large-scale data analysis jobs. 

- Built knowledge of software testing methodologies, CI/CD systems, and agile software development.
