I worked at Convene as a Software Engineer from September 2019 to March 2021.
I worked on a range of full-stack projects supporting Convene's hybrid workplace, meetings and events offerings.

### What I Worked On

- Led the architecture and implementation of Convene's data analytics processing pipeline in Node.js and Postgres, 
ingesting millions of time-series data points per hour to analyze performance of events on Convene's virtual event platform.

- Automated badge printing for Convene's physical spaces, decreasing time to onboard new customers. 
Implemented a Java-based backend running on AWS, which coordinates badge printing jobs with printer hardware.
