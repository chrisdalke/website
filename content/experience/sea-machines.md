I worked as an Autonomy Software Engineer at [Sea Machines](https://sea-machines.com/), a leader in pioneering autonomous control and advanced perception systems for the maritime industry.

### What I Worked On

- Led development of all mission planning user interfaces for new Sea Machines products. Developed a technical architecture based on React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MQTT, and worked with other full-stack developers to implement UI components.

- Maintained core autonomy platform using Python, C/C++, MOOS-IvP and ROS. Developed and tested sensor drivers, high-level autonomy logic, logging & monitoring systems. Worked in the MOOS-IvP autonomy framework to implement new behavior-based autonomy features.

- Transitioned software from ad-hoc communications protocols to a common ROS2/DDS-based framework used on new products.

- Established CI/CD and deployment infrastructure using AWS EC2, ECR, Jenkins, and BalenaCloud, significantly reducing time to deploy to production systems. Improved consistency & reliability of builds by moving the team from manual deployments to automated, containerized builds.

- Implemented API layer on top of Sea Machines technical platform, decoupling user interfaces and third-party integrations from core autonomy & perception code. This rearchitecture enabled the team to refactor internal system components without disruption to customer-facing features. Documented REST API using OpenAPI specification and maintained Sea Machines JavaScript SDKs to interface with the autonomy system.

- Collaborating with captains & operations team, deployed and tested new features on Sea Machines boats in Boston Harbor.
