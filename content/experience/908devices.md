In early 2021, I worked as a Software Engineer in R&D at 908 Devices. While at the company, I built software for 908 Devices' line of portable, chemical analysis devices based on high-pressure mass spectrometry.

### What I Worked On
- Built a system to calibrate high-voltage AC waveform generation, improving accuracy of the mass spectrometry process.
- Implemented memory and architecture improvements in a C++ and Python codebase running on embedded Linux.
- Collaborated with electrical & mechanical engineers to evaluate sensors and components for future products.
