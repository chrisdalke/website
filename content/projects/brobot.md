I'm currently working with Andrew Gutierrez on Brobot: An autonomous beer-pong opponent, built with ROS & RealSense.
**Brobot is an intelligent robot opponent that can play beer pong**. It uses RealSense stereo vision to perceive the environment, senses targets, and accurately launches a ball using a set of dual brushless motors.

Brobot started as a light-hearted question during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic: Could you build and train a robot to play beer pong, ping-pong, or any other party game? 

Brobot runs on a modular software architecture built in ROS. Andrew led the software architecture for the vision systems, and I designed and wrote the embedded software and fabricated the robot's mechanical systems. If you'd like to watch out progress, [check out Brobot's open-source software and hardware
on GitHub](https://github.com/pongrobot).
