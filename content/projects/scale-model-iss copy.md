I'm continually experimenting with autonomy for small vessels using ArduPilot and other
open-source platforms. I'm particularly interested in mission planning and remote operation over long-range connections.

To that end, I wanted to build a simple marine rover as a testbed for autonomy projects. My core requirements were:
- A stable platform with sufficient flotation to support later, undefined payloads
- Minimal moving parts and points of failure in drivetrain
- Good vessel dynamics: Zero turning radius, ability to achieve planing speed
- Relatively inexpensive (<$500)

Based on these requirements, I designed and built a rover based on a boogie board hull and two marine thrusters for differential steering control. I used two [Blue Robotics T200](https://bluerobotics.com/store/thrusters/t100-t200-thrusters/t200-thruster-r2-rp/) thrusters mounted on HDPE sheets. The electronics are contained in a waterproof enclosure with ample room for future expansions.

To verify the design and facilitate later projects based on the platform, I built a complete CAD assembly of the hull and subsystems.

The "Boogie Board Rover" will be a capable platform for future projects. Stay tuned!
