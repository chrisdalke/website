For the last few years, I've periodically worked on a project to build a full-scale pinball machine. This has been a great project for me because I've learned a wealth of knowledge regarding CNC machining techniques and woordworking. I also gained experience in Arduino prototyping and high-power circuit design. This project is still largely a work-in-progress.

Below are some of the screenshots, with the newest at the bottom. Scroll to the bottom to just view the current version or start here to view chronologically.

Some of the pictures were taken with an old cellphone camera so they may be blurry.
